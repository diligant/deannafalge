        p I have so much gratitude for Deanna. She has made a huge impact on my life. Deanna empowered me to become a confident person and appreciate/respect every aspect of myself, whether it is something I can control or not. Thank you Deanna for being there for me and hearing me out when I really needed someone to listen. Thank you helping me figure things out both by myself and with your guidance. It meant the world to me.

          p Deanna is one of the best tutors Romi had.  Not only is she knowledgeable with the study material but knows how to teach in a way that any brain can understand. Very thorough, attentive and patient.  Romi received Aâ€™s with Deanna and was no longer afraid of tests and homework.
